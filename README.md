# Quiz Web Application

## General info

- A quiz app powered by **[Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/)**.
- Visitors are able to choose any amount of questions ranging from 1 to 50 inclusive. In addition to optionally selecting a Category, a type of questions, and choosing the difficulty of to-be-fetched questions.

## My process

- The main purpose of this project was to test my ability in dealing with a little bit more complex API than the ones I worked with before.
- I thought My biggest challenge was going to be the implementing the form which is going to fetch a set of questions, but that was fairly easy task compared to rendering the answers in every question in random order, with respect to their original order in the API.
- Another challenge that I faced was stacking the card over each other, the purpose of this approach is hiding the card that the player answered so that the next question appear after roughly one and a half seconds (ofcourse using setTimeout).
